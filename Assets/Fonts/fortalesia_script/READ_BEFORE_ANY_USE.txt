Fortalesia Script is a flourish-rich calligraphy typeface, designed with elegance and flair. It merges traditional handwriting with luxurious curves, each stroke crafted to enhance the drama and movement of the lettering. The capital letters sweep into wide, expressive loops, while the lowercase maintains classic balance with intricate swashes that create a strong rhythm across words.

This font brings to mind handwritten wedding invitations, high-end branding or ceremonial titles, where beauty and legibility walk hand in hand. The graceful exaggeration of its loops and terminals adds a ceremonial touch without overwhelming the clarity of the script.

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability. 
It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from North Europa to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers. 

Designed and created by Mans Greback, a prolific type designer specializing in high-quality script and display fonts. His work is known for its craftsmanship and attention to detail, blending artistic expression with technical precision.
